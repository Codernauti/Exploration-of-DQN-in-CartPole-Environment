In this work we show an overview of the methods that concern the Reinforcement Learning, specifically, the methods that involves the Q-learning algorithm, come up to the most recent DQN algorithm that combine it to deep neural network.
We present experiments performed on CartPole environment, a "small" challenge, that allowed us to deal with the main issues related to implementation of DQN.

Specifically, we focused on the architectures of the neural networks with shallow and deep configurations.

The experimental results demonstrate that the deep configurations are better.
