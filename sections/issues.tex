\Auth~faced several issues. In particular after an initial effort for understanding the RL area, \auth~had difficulties on debugging and on interpreting the noisy Data, these are typical issues in Deep Reinforcement Learning area~\cite{rlblogpost}. In fact in order to see better the convergence \auth~took the average Q-value from \numepoch~steps.

Another issues is that there are no guarantees that in the next not computed steps the Q-value estimates will not have weird behaviours. An example is the bottom right plot in Figure~\ref{fig:q-values} where after 12000 epoch it seems like a bad behaviour is happening.

Furthermore long testing times due to unoptimized code and limited hardware resources strongly restricted the number of analysed configurations.
