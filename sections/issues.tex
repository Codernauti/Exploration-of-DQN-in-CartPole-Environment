\Auth~faced several issues. In particular after an initial effort for understanding the RL area, \auth~had difficulties on debugging and on interpreting the noisy Data, these are typical issues in Deep Reinforcement Learning area~\cite{rlblogpost}. In fact in order to see better the convergence \auth~took the average Q-value from \numepoch~steps.

Another issues is that the data obtained need to be huge in order to have reasonable consideration, but more data means also a more probability of human errors if the process are not all automated.

Furthermore long testing times due to unoptimized code and limited hardware resources strongly restricted the number of analysed configurations.
