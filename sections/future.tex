\subsection{Continuous time}

The version of the CartPole that we used, limits the steps to 200. It can be undoubtedly interesting, perform the same experiments on the version that has no time limits.

We have observed several trained agents able to successfully overcome the task, ie able to obtain an average reward above 195 out of a total of 100 games. Many of them, get the necessary points while moving with speed to a side, "unaware" of the boundaries of the gaming environment, the left and right ends.
In a continuous environment, this oscillation would inevitably lead them to failure.

\subsection{Reward function redesign}

To limit the "suicidal" oscillations towards the extremes, a possible strategy, is to redesign the reward function: the reward is decremented as much as the agent is far from the center.
